### ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome to my Page!
***
I started learning to code in early 2020 and quickly came to love programming. Since then I've been teaching myself to code using Udemy before attending the Flatiron Full-Stack Software engineering Bootcamp in 2020, learning JavaScript, React/Redux, and Ruby on Rails.

For the last two years, I have worked mainly in front-end development. In my last role, I developed user-interface components, implemented responsive design, and collaborated with a graphic designer to revamp an internal and external client portal for a laboratory billing company. I also have completed over 50 bug fixes that helped improve user experience tremendously.

One of my projects is a Github Profile finder app ([demo link](https://github-finder-rho-ashy.vercel.app/)), which allows users to search GitHub profiles. Another project is a Pet Care app ([demo link](https://pet-careapp.herokuapp.com/)), which allows users to keep track of their pet's needs.
