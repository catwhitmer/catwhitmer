### ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome!
***
I started learning to code in late 2019 and quickly came to love programming. Since then I've been teaching myself to code using Udemy before attending the Flatiron Full-Stack Software engineering Bootcamp in 2020, learning JavaScript, React/Redux, and Ruby on Rails.

One of my projects is a Pet Care app ([demo link](https://pet-careapp.herokuapp.com/)), which allows users to keep track of their pet's needs. Another project is a Github Profile finder app ([demo link](https://github-finder-rho-ashy.vercel.app/)), which allows users to search GitHub profiles.
