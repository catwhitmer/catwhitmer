### ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome to my Page!
***
I started learning to code in late 2019 and quickly came to love programming. Since then I've been teaching myself to code using online courses and websites before attending the Flatiron Full-Stack Software engineering Bootcamp in 2020, learning JavaScript, React/Redux, and Ruby on Rails.

For the last two years, I have worked mainly in front-end development. In my last role, I developed user-interface components, implemented responsive design, and collaborated with a graphic designer to revamp an internal and external client portal for a laboratory billing company. I also have completed over 50 bug fixes that helped improve user experience tremendously.

One of my projects is a Support Desk app ([demo link](https://wildelksupportdesk.herokuapp.com/)), which allows users to log in and submit tickets. Another project is a House Marketplace app ([demo link](https://house-marketplace-app-gamma-sooty.vercel.app/)), which allows users to buy/sell houses.
