### ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome to my GitHub page!
***
I started learning to code in January 2020 and quickly came to love programming. Since then I've been teaching myself to code and also attended the Flatiron Full-Stack Software engineering Bootcamp, learning JavaScript, React/Redux, and Ruby on Rails.

One of my projects is a Github Profile finder app ([demo link](https://github-finder-rho-ashy.vercel.app/)), which allows users to search GitHub profiles. Another project is a Pet Care app ([demo link](https://pet-careapp.herokuapp.com/)), which allows users to keep track of their pet's needs.

### I'm comfortable using:
HTML5 ~ CSS3 ~ JavaScript ~ React ~ Redux ~ TypeScript ~ styled-components ~ Material-UI ~ git ~ Express.JS ~ Node.JS
