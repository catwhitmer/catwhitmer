### ðŸ‘‹ Hi and welcome to my GitHub page!
***
I started learning to code in January 2020 and quickly came to love programming. Since then I've been teaching myself to code through Udemy. I also attented the Flatiron Full-Stack Software engineering bootcamp, learning React and JavaScript.

One of my projects is a Github user finder app ([demo link](https://github-finder-rho-ashy.vercel.app/)), which allows users to search github profiles. Another project is a Pet Care app ([demo link](https://github.com/catwhitmer/petCare)).

### I'm comfortable using:
HTML5 ~ CSS3 ~ JavaScript ~ React ~ Redux ~ TypeScript ~ styled-components ~ Material-UI ~ git ~ Express ~ NodeJS

### What am I doing right now?

-Rebuilding my [Pet Care](https://github.com/catwhitmer/petCare) app using React 18, Redux, and Express <br>
-Deep Dive into CSS <br>

My next project: a GitHub finder app <br>

Things I Enjoy:
